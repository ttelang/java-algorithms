# Java Algorithms, Data Structures and Design Patterns
Algorithms, data structures and Design Patterns implemented in Java with explanations and links to further readings included in the Wiki Pages for this project

This repository contains Java based examples of many popular algorithms, data structures and design patterns.

Each algorithm, data structure and data structures has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).
